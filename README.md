with this component you can very simply popout part of your Angular application to a new un-docked browser child window.

I have thrived for a minimal footprint, ease of use, clean and compatible code. 

the component itself is **PopoutWindowComponent**

please run the demo app to see some funky stuff.

...stay tuned.
