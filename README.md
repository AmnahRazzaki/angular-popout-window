with this component you can very simply popout part of your Angular application to a new un-docked child window.

I have thrived for a minimal footprint, ease of use, clean and compatible code. 

the component itself is **PopoutWindowComponent**

please run the demo app to see some demo funky stuff.

*(it is work in progress, use on your own risk)*

- currently it is ng11 soon will match lower versions.
- stay tuned.
